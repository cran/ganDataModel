Description: Neural networks are applied to create a density value function which approximates density values for a data source. The trained neural network is analysed for different levels. For each level subspaces with density values above a level are determined. The obtained set of subspaces categorizes the data source hierarchically. A prerequisite is the definition of a data source, the generation of generative data and the calculation of density values. These tasks are executed using package 'ganGenerativeData' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ganGenerativeData>.
